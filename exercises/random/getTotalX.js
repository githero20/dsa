// There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

// The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
// The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
// These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

// Example:
// a = [2, 6]
// b = [24, 36]
// answer = 3
